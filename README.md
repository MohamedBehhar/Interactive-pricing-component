### The challenge

The objective of this challenge is to create an interactive pricing component.
I decided to take on this challenge using SCSS and absolutely loved it, it helps me keep my work organized.
I also used JavaScript DOM to create the interactive pricing slider.
This is my solution for this challenge, I hope you like it, and if you have any suggestions or remarks, please don't hesitate to contact me.
